        <h2>The British Monarchy</h2>
      <div class="LargeA">A</div>
        <p>
        HUNDRED and thirty years ago it looked as if the British monarchy were doomed. In the aftermath of Waterloo a King, who in his youth had seen his transatlantic subjects repudiate kings forever, wandered, blind, crazed, and with unkempt, snowy beard, through the padded rooms of Windsor Castle, forgotten and neglected. His son, who became George IV-a fat, spoilt,
        flouncing roué-was so unpopular that he dared not drive through the London streets. When his long-forsaken wife, who had been living abroad with an Italian courier, visited England to claim her place as Queen, the mob tried to rise and dethrone him in her favour. A few years later, the future of the dynasty depended on a single child named Victoria whom few expected to ascend 
        the throne and fewer still to die on it. Al- most every progressive subscribed to the radical philosophy and believed that England, following the example of America, would become a republic. Since then nearly the whole of the old world as well as the new has repudiated the conception of king-ship. But, instead of growing weaker, the English Monarchy has grown stronger. 
        It was far more firmly es- tablished in 1901 when Queen Vic- toria died than it was in 1837 when she ascended the throne. Today it is probably stronger and is certainly more popular than in 1901. When I was a boy, Socialist and Radical news- papers habitually attacked the Royal Family in the most insulting terms. Today they scarcely ever attack it at all. 
        No British newspaper with a pop- ular circulation could hope to main- tain its sales if it did BO. This may seem curious, for since those days the British people have grown progressively mure Rad- ical and Socialist. They are probably far more so today than the Republicans and Democrats of the United States. Yet they have come to think of their Throne as an essential 
        part of the democratic machinery of govern- ment.
